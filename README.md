## Times Trainer

The UK government recently (3rd Jan 2016) announced that every pupil in England will be tested on their times tables before leaving primary school ([BBC: Times tables 'to be tested by age 11'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35216318)).

This is an Android app for training kids in their times tables. It asks all variations from 1x1 to 12x12 as expected by the government plans.

The features planned are:

* Ask times tables up to 12x12
* Provide a login page
* Store a [local] record of the answers given for each person
* Provide reports showing how you've done
